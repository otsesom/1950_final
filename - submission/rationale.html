                    <h1>Project Rationale</h1>
                    <p>On our <a href="/students/mto12/comp1950/index.html">COMP 1950 prototype website</a>, we inplemented a significant number of changes to help enhance the learning experience for the students, and teaching tools of the instructor.</p>
                    <h2>Assumptions</h2>
                    <p>For our project, we assumed that the course is already in week 11, hence all lecture content pages are available. If implemented, the lecture content pages would be made available as the course progresses.</p>
                    <h2>Changes Implemented</h2>
                    <p>The newly designed BCIT Comp 1950 page contains many new features and changes which will increase the interaction from students. Some of the main problems that we were facing when using the site was the overloading of content displayed for the user. In order to overcome this obstacle, the lecture slides were transformed into a PowerPoint style of presentation. The PowerPoint style allowed students to focus on certain topics in the lecture and also allowed easy navigation in order to search for particular sections. In the lecture slides, we used certain growing and shrinking effects in particular slides to show particular sections of information we wanted to show. The sections were categorized and information within those section was store under the main headers. Navigation through the lectures was easily done through the use of the space bar and the arrow keys. The space bar allowed the slides to move in an orderly fashion, while the arrow keys allowed you to move through sections.</p>

                    <p>One of the big changes we have done to the page was changing the content that was displayed in the home and about. Our big issue with these pages were that they showed redundancy because of the repetitions of information displayed in each page. We decided to merge the home and about page together after noticing many similarities between the two. This increased the efficiency of the site, allowing it to become more concise with content and location of the content.</p>
                    <p>The previous website included a vertical navigation which took up a lot of the content space, so we decided to make a horizontal navigation to increase the space that could be used for the main website content.</p>
                    <h2>Future Implementation Considerations</h2>
                    <p>CodeMirror - This plugin would allow the instructor and students to view and edit html, css, and javascript code right in the browser window, and view the edits live. This could be used by the instructor to quickly demonstrate concepts without having to switch between multiple programs.</p>
                    <p>Quiz software with possible automatic, instant grading. This function could be implemented with BCIT's existing D2L system. Students would already have login access, and may already be familiar with the format from previous classes. Implementing this will help COMP1950 go paperless!</p>
                    <p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/" target="_blank">JSFiddle</a> for Excercises - JSFiddle could be used for excercises, in addition to the .zip files that were on the legacy website. As with CodeMirror mentioned above, jsfiddle will allow students to tinker with code within the browser, without having to download and fine zip files. JSFiddles could be prepped by the instructor with existing excercise content, and linked to on the lecture pages of the COMP1950 website.</p>
                    <p>User access restrictions. This can either be implemented using one username &amp; password combination for the entire class, or by using a service to require each user to authenticate using their own BCIT credentials. Having access restrictions would allow the instructor to prevent people not in the course from access proprietary information.</p>
