					<h3>Christopher Pickwell</h3>
					<p>My name is Christopher Pickwell and I'm taking COMP 1950 to expand my knowledge of web design to either pursue 
					it directly as career or as a support skill in an engineering field.My ability with HTML and CSS is all right, though given that the bulk of it has been learned within the last few weeks there's no doubt a fair bit of learning that I haven't put to the test yet.
